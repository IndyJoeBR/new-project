<h1>My Webpage</h1>
<p>My name is Joseph Benson, but I pretty much strictly go by "Joe".  I like casual.
    I have a B.S. in Classical Archaeology and did 2.5 years of graduate school towards
    a M.A. in Anthropology specializing in Irish Archaeology.  I failed to finish writing
    my thesis prior to leaving school to work as an archaeological field technician until 
    August 7th 1998.  More than less, since then, I have been an adiministrative assistant.
    I don't want to be one any longer.
